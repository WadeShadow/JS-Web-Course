    <h1>Promises</h1>
    <h2>Promise is an object that:</h3>
        <h3>1.Keeps track of whether a given event has already happened or not</h3>
        <h3>2.Determines, what happens after the event has happened</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>Promises states:</h2>
        <h3>Pending (the event has not yet happened)</h3>
        <h3>Settled/Resolved (event happened after the promise being pending)</h3>
        <h3>If the promise's result has been successfully gained, it becomes Fulfilled</h3>
        <h3>If the promise ends with an error, it becomes <span>Rejected</span></h3>
